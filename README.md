## Description

This is a budget tracking app using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Heroku and Mongoose. Majority of the front end code was provided in a homework as part of a web development boot camp. Allows the user to track their expenses and save them in a database. This is a progressive web app (PWA) where transactions are cached for offline use. 

The front-end was already provided and only server, routes, service-worker and manifest had to be added.
